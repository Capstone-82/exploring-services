Cloud Services Exploration – Phase 1
Overview

This repository contains Phase 1 exploration work of our capstone project focused on AWS cloud services, AI services (Bedrock), cost analysis, and basic governance concepts.
The phase mainly involved hands-on exploration, API integrations, benchmarking, and proof-of-concept implementations.
